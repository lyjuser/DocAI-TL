# DocAI-TL
DocAI-TL: Structured Document Tampering Localization with DocAI Model

![Method Overview](figure/image.png)

## Requirments

For environment setup, please follow the [SAM-Adapter installation](https://github.com/tianrun-chen/SAM-Adapter-PyTorch/blob/main/requirements.txt).

## Dataset
The T-CERT, T-FUNSD and tampered receipts from T-IDR are publicly available. However, ID cards cannot be shared due to licensing restrictions.

You can download the above datasets [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/18UNBbFuBINNDsERSeSrzyg)   ðŸ”‘Extraction code: `nzis`

## DocAI pretrained weight
You can download the DocAI (LayoutLMv3, LayoutLMv2, and LiLT) pretrained weight [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1TnmtEzcdGPcb7Gv_CdefFg)  ðŸ”‘Extraction code: `ntxy`

## SAM model weight
You can download the weights of SAM ViT-L and SAM-Adapter [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1GOypB9BHTooIWZNr0FneNQ)   ðŸ”‘Extraction code: `g88u`

## Train
